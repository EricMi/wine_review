# RAMP starting kit on Wine Review Prediction

Authors: Boyao ZHOU, Pengfei MI, Rui SONG

Te goal of this project is to indentify the wine by using the description of the sommelier and some category features. We want to apply text mining and word embedding techniques into this project. In addition, we will extract some longitutde and latitude information from external source to improve our model. In the end, we want to give a more reasonable "point" and "price" based on the experimental description and the scientific indicator for the new wine of this year. The predictions will be used as decision support of an online wine store such that the price and rating this store gives will match the consumers' expectations and further experiences.
